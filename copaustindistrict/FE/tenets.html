        <button class="accordion">EVANGELISM</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="accordion-p" id="p-1">
            It is the presentation of Jesus Christ in the power of the Holy
            Spirit with the view that people will come and trust Jesus as
            Saviour and Lord and serve him in the fellowship of the Church.
            Evangelism is the responsibility of every Church member. It is the
            prime duty of every believer to share his/her faith after
            conversion.<br />
            The scope of evangelism was initially Ghana, extending to Africa and
            to the whole world. Evangelism is missions-oriented; farmers, women,
            artisans, fishermen, intellectuals, etc. go out into other
            countries, preach Christ, open churches and call in ministers to
            pastor same. Besides, as was the practice of the founder, Pastor
            James McKeown, we respond to calls to missions as led by the Spirit
            of the Lord.

        <button class="accordion">DISCIPLESHIP</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="accordion-p">
            Discipleship is training believers to be like Christ. The emphasis
            is on holiness, righteousness, faithfulness, honesty, sincerity,
            humility, prayerfulness and the leading of disciplined and
            responsible lives.
            <br />
            This is done at the level of individuals, where every member takes
            responsibility to discipline their new coverts, as well as through
            church/corporate based systematic teaching, and on-the-job training.
            <br />
            Teaching emphasizes the four-square gospel, which is
            Christ-centered: i.e. Jesus the Saviour, Healer, Baptizer and Soon
            Coming King; the Tenets of the Church; Bible reading/study and
            scripture memorization and application of the word to life
            situations.
          </p>

        <button class="accordion">MINISTRY EXCELLENCE</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="accordion-p">
            We seek to honour God who gave His best (the Saviour) by maintaining
            a high standard of excellence in all our ministries and activities
            (Colossians 3:23-24).
          </p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">CORE PRACTICES</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="accordion-p">Some of the normal practices are regular prayer for the Holy Spirit baptism with initial evidence of speaking in tongues. Emphasis is placed on the fruit and gifts of the Spirit in the life of the believer.<br>
            Prayers are said for healing and deliverance for the afflicted as part of the initial exercises for salvation. <br />
            Services are marked as truly Pentecostal with praise and worship, teaching, exercise of gifts, prayer, testimony, etc.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">THE HOLY SPIRIT</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="accordion-p">We believe in the presence of the person of the Holy Spirit and that the Christian life can be led only with His grace. The new birth is the work of the Holy Spirit, and then the baptism of the Holy Spirit for power to serve and the gifts of the Spirit for building the body of Christ.<br>
            The Holy Spirit helps the individual to develop a Christ-like character, manifest through bearing the fruit of the Spirit. <br>
            The leading of the Holy Spirit in all spheres of activity in the Church is paramount. Administrative structures and all other church distinctiveness have been by the leading of the Holy Spirit. The Church, through her leadership at all levels, co-operates in obedience.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">LEADERSHIP</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="accordion-p">Leadership development is based on the apostolic foundation. Appointments and callings into leadership positions are based on character and charisma, and the leading of the Holy Spirit. Leadership development is from the shop floor, grass root level with members maturing to lead sub-groups, movements, assemblies, districts and areas. Team spirit with talent development shapes team work. Ministry is by both clergy and laity.</p>
